# ArcFace Implementation in TensorFlow 2.0+ (Xception)

This repository provides an unofficial implementation of [ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698) in TensorFlow 2.0+ using the Xception architecture. The ArcFace model, as published in CVPR 2019, aims to enhance deep face recognition by incorporating an additive angular margin loss.

## Overview

ArcFace is designed to improve the discriminative power of face recognition models by adding an angular margin penalty to the softmax function. This implementation leverages the Xception architecture and has been trained on the MS1M-ArcFace dataset using Kaggle TPU.

- **Model Architecture**: Xception
- **Training Dataset**: [MS1M-ArcFace](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonhcwong/faces-ms1m-refine-v2-112x112-tfrecord)
- **Benchmark Accuracy**: 99.4% on LFW

## Features

- TensorFlow 2.0+ compatibility
- Implementation of ArcFace loss for improved face recognition
- Pre-trained model achieving high accuracy on the LFW benchmark
